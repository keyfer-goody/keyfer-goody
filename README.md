Hey, I'm Keyfer ðŸ‘‹.

I'm currently at [Goody](https://www.ongoody.com/) as a VP of Engineering. Outside of the computer world, I am an avid biker, love to play hockey, and enjoy coffee more than I should. I live in Edmonton, AB, with my wife Sammy and our dog Poppy. I feel an earnest and humble desire to increase the world's stock of happiness.
